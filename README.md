Fake News Prediction in Social Media
Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect and classify fake news spread across social media platforms. With the rise of misinformation, it's crucial to have tools that can help users identify fake news and prevent its spread. This repository contains the code and model to classify news articles as real or fake based on textual content.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw social media news data for analysis.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Feature extraction from text using TF-IDF, word embeddings, and other NLP techniques.
Fake News Detection: Machine learning models to classify news as fake or real.
Visualization: Displays the distribution of real and fake news in the dataset and feature importance in prediction.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for evaluating the model.
Dataset
The dataset contains a collection of labeled social media news articles. Each article is classified as real or fake. You can download the dataset from here (provide link).

Dataset Structure
Text: The content of the news article.
Label: 1 for real news, 0 for fake news.
A typical entry in the dataset looks like this:

Article Title	Text	Label
News Title A	This is the text of a real news article.	1
News Title B	This is the text of a fake news article.	0
Project Architecture
Data Collection: Data is gathered from various social media platforms and news sources.
Data Preprocessing: The text is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Training: Different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) are trained to classify the articles as real or fake.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: The trained model can be used to predict whether new social media posts or articles are real or fake.
Model
Several machine learning algorithms are employed to detect fake news, including:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
XGBoost
Preprocessing Steps
Text Cleaning: Remove stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
Tokenization: Split the text into tokens (words).
Vectorization: Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical vectors.
Train/Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Training Details
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
